##DESCRIPTION## :- This Repository creates two tables: employee and department, inserts sample data, and demonstrates SQL join operations to combine data meaningfully. 

It performs:

1. INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching DepartmentID in both tables.
2. LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from employee, with NULL for unmatched departments.
3. RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from department, with NULL for unmatched employees.
4. FULL OUTER JOIN: Combines all rows
